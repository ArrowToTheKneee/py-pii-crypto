# ðŸ§  Why Use a Factory and Facade for Key Handling

## âœ… Factory (e.g., `KeyProviderFactory`)
- **Responsibility**: Instantiates the appropriate key provider (`FileKeyProvider`, `VaultKeyProvider`, etc.) based on configuration.
- **Purpose**: Decouples the logic of *which* provider to use from the rest of your application.
- **Benefit**: Makes the system extensible and easy to switch key backends without code changes.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  provider = KeyProviderFactory.get_provider("vault")
  ```

## âœ… Facade (e.g., `KeyManager`)
- **Responsibility**: Provides a unified interface (`get_key`, `generate_keys`, `rotate_keys`) to the selected provider.
- **Purpose**: Simplifies key management and usage across the codebase.
- **Benefit**: 
  - Centralizes logic like caching, logging, and fallback.
  - Hides provider-specific implementation from consumers.
  - Easier to test, maintain, and extend.

## âœ… Analogy Table

| Concept   | Role                            | Analogy                     |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Factory   | Chooses backend provider         | Like selecting a DB driver  |
| Facade    | Unified API over all providers   | Like a service wrapper      |
| Provider  | Backend-specific implementation  | Knows how to talk to Vault/File |

## âœ… TL;DR Sticky Note
> Use a **Factory** to select which key provider to use, and a **Facade (KeyManager)** to wrap the provider with a consistent interface. This ensures your encryption/decryption logic stays decoupled, testable, and backend-agnostic.
