# 📄 Why Use a Metadata Manager and Metadata File per Dataset

In secure data handling, particularly when dealing with encryption of sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information), maintaining structured metadata for each encrypted dataset is critical. This document outlines **why a Metadata Manager and metadata file are essential**, especially when scaling your encryption pipeline or adhering to regulatory standards.

## 🧠 Purpose of a Metadata File

When you encrypt a dataset (e.g., a CSV file), certain encryption parameters are used that are necessary for:

- Decryption
- Audit and traceability
- Future compatibility
- Security assurance

A metadata file **stores this information once per dataset**, avoiding redundant row-level duplication while still maintaining important encryption context.

## 🔐 What Metadata to Store

| Metadata Field       | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `algorithm`          | E.g., `AES-GCM`, to ensure proper decryption later |
| `key_version`        | Which version of the key was used for encryption |
| `fields_encrypted`   | Which columns in the dataset were encrypted |
| `timestamp`          | When the encryption occurred |
| `software_version`   | Version of the tool used (important for backward compatibility) |
| `data_hash` (optional) | To detect tampering or corruption |

---

## ✅ Why It’s Useful

### 1. **Auditability**
Encryption metadata helps answer:  
> _"Who encrypted this file, with what key, when, and using which algorithm?"_  
This is essential for regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, FDA).

### 2. **Reproducibility**
If a dataset is encrypted today and decrypted months later (or by another system), the metadata ensures it can be decrypted correctly regardless of:
- Key rotations
- Algorithm upgrades
- Software version changes

### 3. **Simplified Decryption Logic**
Decryption tools can read the metadata file and:
- Automatically fetch the right key version
- Know which fields to decrypt
- Use the correct algorithm without user intervention

### 4. **Minimal Overhead**
Unlike row-level metadata (which adds size to every row), a metadata file is:
- Stored once per file
- Small in size (~1–2 KB)
- Easily shared or archived alongside the encrypted dataset

## 🧰 Role of the MetadataManager Class

A `MetadataManager`:
- Writes metadata to a JSON sidecar file after encryption
- Reads metadata before decryption
- Dynamically fetches software version using Python’s `importlib.metadata`
- Can be extended to support checksum validation or encryption policy tracking

---

## 📦 Example

Given:
- Encrypted file: `enc.csv`

Your sidecar file: `enc.csv.meta.json`

```json
{
  "algorithm": "AES-GCM",
  "key_version": "v3",
  "fields_encrypted": ["name", "email", "ssn"],
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T15:00:00Z",
  "software_version": "piicrypto-1.4.0"
}
```

This is sufficient for future tools to correctly and securely decrypt the file.

## 📌 Conclusion

Even if your current system works without metadata files, adopting them makes your solution:
- More robust
- Easier to maintain
- Future-proof
- Auditable and regulatory-compliant

It's a one-time design upgrade with ongoing benefits.
